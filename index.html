            <p id="about">My name is Florencia, I'm a Web Development student currently studying in JaP. I'm fully 
                interested in this field and anything that's got to do with the digital world. I've studied 
                Digital Marketing Analyst and I have some experience as a Community Manager as well.

                I've also studied Film, I don't know yet how to relate the two but I think I'll find out sooner or later.<br>
                Also, a note, I love Buttercup and most people in my life associte me with her, so that's why I decided to use her.

                I'm excited to learn more about programming and hope to get a job based on it. I look forward to
                this course and I hope at the end of the year I'll be able to leave this page resembling somewhat 
                like a pro.
